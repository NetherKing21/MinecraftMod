3. Find the list of unique requirements for your selected module in the Module Summary in Canvas.  In some circumstances, you will need to modify the requirements based on the technology or language you selected.  For the Choose Your Own Adventure, you need to create your own requirements.  List the unique module requirements below:

- Complete the following
    - Add new/more advanced items (ideas include food, fuel, other unique items)
    - Learn about tags 
    - Learn about data generation (creating json file auto-magically)
- Possible Stretch Challenges
    - add mob to the game

### Section 1.2 - Planning

During the Sprint, you will spend 4 hours in class meetings, 4 hours on your team project (2 of which during class), and 10 hours on your selected module.  Make a plan for your 10 hours by answering the questions below.  You should refer back to this plan and make adjustments during the Sprint.

1. What sources have you selected to learn the technical material? 
    - [Modding Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLKGarocXCE1H9Y21-pxjt5Pt8bW14twa-)

2. What is your plan to practice the new material?  In other words, what is the order in which you plan to learn the material before working on your demonstration software? 
    - Continue adding onto my mod by adding new thing and try experimenting with my own ideas

3. What demonstration software do you plan on submitting at the end of the Sprint (note that this can and may change)?
    - show a demonstration of the mod running and the new gamemachanics that were added.

4. Identify the days, times, and locations that you will work on the module.
    - Monday 8-9pm at home
    - Tuesday 8-9am at home
    - Wednesday 8-9pm at home
    - Thursday 8-9am at home
    - Friday 8-9pm at home

5. Identify both a technical risk and a behavioral risk that you antcipate may occur during this Sprint.  What is your mitgigation plan?
    - I a betting that I will try and do or complete too much or try and do something too complicated. If I start trying to do too much I will do a reality check to see if that is necessary or if I outlined that in my requirements. If I find something is too complicated I will see if I can just do the first step of that.


## Part 2 - Time Log

This section should be filled out during the Sprint. 

Record all CSE 310 work that you do on your individual module or the team project.  Include time learning, practicing, developing, testing, and documenting.  Don't include time spent in the 4 class meetings (Planning, Stand-Up, Team Review, and Individual Review).  You will need to sum of these hours at the end of the Sprint. Note that the hours you report will affect your grades.

Note that `IM` stands for Individual Module and `TP` stands for Team Project.
