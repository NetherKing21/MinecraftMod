Name: Brayden McAllister

## Part 1 - Module Planning

This section should be filled on the first Monday of the Sprint and submitted

### Section 1.1 - Module Selection

1. What Sprint is this for (1-5)? 3

2. Select the Module (with a single X) that you will do this Sprint:

|Module                   |Selected Module|
|-------------------------|---------------|

|Choose Your Own Adventure|               |

3. Find the list of unique requirements for your selected module in the Module Summary in Canvas.  In some circumstances, you will need to modify the requirements based on the technology or language you selected.  For the Choose Your Own Adventure, you need to create your own requirements.  List the unique module requirements below:

For this sprint to learn Java I want to make a minecraft mod. So my requirements for this will be to make a minecraft mod that adds new items, blocks, mobs and interactive blocks (blocks with a user interface).

If it proves to be too difficult to learn Java I will drop the mod and complete the requirements for learning Java.
Write one or more programs in Java that demonstrates some of the following:
    -Variables
    -Expressions
    -Conditionals
    -Loops
    -Functions
    -Classes
    -Data structure from Java Collection Framework (such as ArrayList, TreeSet, or HashMap)
Stretch Challenges (select one):
    -Modify your program to read and write to a file.
    -Modify your program to demonstrate inheritance using the extends and abstract keywords.
    -Modify your program to create an interface and then use it with the implements keyword.

### Section 1.2 - Planning

During the Sprint, you will spend 4 hours in class meetings, 4 hours on your team project (2 of which during class), and 10 hours on your selected module.  Make a plan for your 10 hours by answering the questions below.  You should refer back to this plan and make adjustments during the Sprint.

1. What sources have you selected to learn the technical material?
 - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55qUIf3GMss (Minecraft modding tutorial)
 - https://codakid.com/guide-to-minecraft-modding-with-java/ (Read along tutorial)
2. What is your plan to practice the new material?  In other words, what is the order in which you plan to learn the material before working on your demonstration software?
    My plan it to work on these in the following
     - add an item to minecraft
     - add a block to minecraft
     - make the block that drops a new item
     - (add ore generation??)
     - simple crafting recipes to minecraft
     - add mob to minecraft (animations not needed to start)
3. What demonstration software do you plan on submitting at the end of the Sprint (note that this can and may change)?
    I plan on submitting a demostration of the minecraft mod running (show some of the code) but if I can't figure out the modding I will submit a simple java program
4. Identify the days, times, and locations that you will work on the module.
    Monday, Wednessday, Friday 8:00-9:00pm At home
    Tuesday, Thursday 1:00-3:00pm In the STC
5. Identify both a technical risk and a behavioral risk that you antcipate may occur during this Sprint.  What is your mitgigation plan?
    If I can't figure out the modding I will just learn Java and prepare example program that deminstates the different requrirements


## Part 2 - Time Log

This section should be filled out during the Sprint. 

Record all CSE 310 work that you do on your individual module or the team project.  Include time learning, practicing, developing, testing, and documenting.  Don't include time spent in the 4 class meetings (Planning, Stand-Up, Team Review, and Individual Review).  You will need to sum of these hours at the end of the Sprint. Note that the hours you report will affect your grades.

Note that `IM` stands for Individual Module and `TP` stands for Team Project.

## Part 3 - Module Results

This section should be filled out at the end of the Sprint and submitted.

1. Put your GitHub link for your demonstration software here: https://github.com/NetherKing21/MinecraftMod

2. Put your YouTube link for your code walkthrough and demo video here: https://youtu.be/tvoRb5P3J8w

3. Complete the following checklist by either indicating "Yes" or "No". If you indicate "No" then provide an explanation of why beneath the table.

|Question                                                    |Response|
|------------------------------------------------------------|--------|
|Are the links above public and working?                     | yes    |
|Did you complete all the unique requirements for the module?| yes    |
|Did you write at least 100 lines of code?                   | yes    |
|Did you fully complete the readme.md file?                  | yes    |
|Did you put the readme.md file in GitHub in the top folder? | yes    |

4. If you completed a Stretch Challenge (as shown in the Module Description document in Canvas) then describe what you did.  If you did the Choose Your Own Adventure module, then you get to decide what qualifies as a Stretch Challenge.
I added block properties to the thicc slime block and now it slows you down when you walk on it, similar to soul sand

5. Did you change your selected module during the middle of the Sprint?  If yes, then describe what you changed it to, when you changed it, and why you changed it. 
No

6. Using the log above, fill in the total hours and minutes you spent on the individual module:

|Activity         |Total Hours:Minutes|
|-----------------|-------------------|
|Individual Module| 10:30             |

7. What strategies (behavioral and technical) worked well during this Sprint?  What did not work well?  List some possible ways that you can improve next Sprint.
For this sprint I focused on something that I knew I would enjoy. Having an interest in what you are working on helps motivation. I was also able to work on it earlier in the week and that helped to alleviate the stress. Things that did not work out was that progress was slower than I thought. When making a mod you have to add everything concerning the different items/blocks and there were many things that I didn't take into account.kk
